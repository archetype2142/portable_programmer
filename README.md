# portable_programmer
work on banana pro at lemaker.org

The portable programmer is a small device based on Banana pro, a single board computer.
it runs on bananian linux and takes advantage on linux's terminal to compile thhe code.
I have made a small shell script which creates a directory called programming and makes a new file called main.cpp in it, we can edit this file using nano. 
once saved, the file will be automatically compile using g++ and executed.
