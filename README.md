Work on banana pro at [http://forum.lemaker.org/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=11702&extra=](Lemaker)

## Intro
The **portable programmer** is a small device based on Banana pro, a single board computer.
It runs on bananian linux and takes advantage on linux's terminal to compile the code.
I have made a small shell script which creates a directory called **programming** and makes a new file called **main.cpp** in it, we can edit this file using any text editor(I prefer nano). 
once saved, the file will be automatically compile using **g++** and executed.

The work is limited to my knowlegde about shell scripting, fork this repo, help make it better **^_^**
